A simple 3d scanner software, it takes images taken from different 
kown angles of an object, with a line projected on them to create a 3d 
image 
from them. 

software implemented in matlab, i uses arduino for the hardware to turn 
the object and trigger the camera, there's a shell script for doing, 
this automatically.
